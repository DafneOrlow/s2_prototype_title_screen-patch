; =========================
; PATCH: Integrate Prototype Title Screen assets
; Place the files from this zip into your s2disasm tree:
;  - art/nemesis/TitleScr.nem
;  - mappings/misc/TitleScr.eni
;  - art/palettes/TitlScrn.pal
;
; Then, add or modify the following small ASM snippet in your disassembly (suggested: create a file Data/TitlePrototypePatch.asm and include it where other data is included).
; This snippet tells the build which art/mapping/palette to use for the title screen.
; Adjust paths if your project uses different directories.
;
; NOTE: s2disasm's build process may not reference files directly by filename. If your build uses explicit binary includes, replace the example .incbin lines with the assembler directives your toolchain expects.
; Example shown assumes including binary data directly into the ROM at appropriate labels.

; --- Example labels (match labels used by s2disasm constants) ---
; If these labels already exist elsewhere, rename or comment out the originals before assembling.

SECTION	"TitlePrototypeArt",ROM0

; Prototype Title Screen Nemesis data
; Make sure assembler supports INCFILE or similar. Here we use a generic .incbin directive; change to your assembler's directive if different.
Art_TitleProto:
    ; include binary nemesis data
    ; adjust path as necessary relative to your build root
    incbin "art/nemesis/TitleScr.nem"

; Prototype title screen mapping (eni)
Map_TitleProto:
    incbin "mappings/misc/TitleScr.eni"

; Prototype title screen palette
Pal_TitleProto:
    incbin "art/palettes/TitlScrn.pal"

; --- Hooking into title load ---
; Find where the retail title screen loads its art/mapping/palette.
; Commonly labels like ArtPtr_Title, MapPtr_Title, PalPtr_Title are used.
; Replace those pointers with the prototype labels, for example:
;   dc.l Art_TitleProto
;   dc.l Map_TitleProto
;   dc.l Pal_TitleProto
;
; If the pointers are defined in s2.constants.asm, you can change like:
;   ; old:
;   ; PalPtr_Title: dc.l art/palettes/Title screen.bin
;   ; new:
;   PalPtr_Title: dc.l Pal_TitleProto
;
; If you're unsure where to edit: search s2disasm for 'PalPtr_Title' or 'ArtTile_ArtNem_Title' and update accordingly.

; --- Final notes ---
; - After adding files & patch, run the normal build (make/build.bat).
; - If the palette looks wrong, it's likely a 16-color vs 32-color mismatch or endian issue; let me know and I can adjust the palette format.
; - If the ROM fails to build due to label conflicts, send me the error and I will create a version fully integrated into the s2disasm tree.
