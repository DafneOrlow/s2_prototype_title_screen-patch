I have no idea where from OR when I downloaded these files, but their purpouse appears to be replacement of the title screen in the Sonic 2 (final) disassembly, with the prototype look/design.
I've had very limited success getting this to work.
Personally, I believe the files are incomplete. But there's no name of the creator listed or links in the readme. And Google is less than helpful finding a source.
